# Assets Changelog

Skills, agents, and ontology data changes belong here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `assets/skills/` is the single authored source for all six skills — `write`, `search`, `link`, `distill`, `status`, `doctor` — replacing four drifted copies. Frontmatter is restricted to `name`, `description`, `aliases`, `mcp_tool` and `mcp_args`; the five skills that declare a tool are validated against that tool's advertised schema, so a skill cannot ship arguments its tool would reject.

### Removed

- `skills-manifest.yaml`. It declared itself generated while no generator existed, had no consumer anywhere in the source, scripts or CI, and never shipped in the package.
