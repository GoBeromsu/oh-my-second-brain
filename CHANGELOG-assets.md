### Fixed

- Packaged host guidance names the invocations each host actually installs. Codex namespaces every skill under an `oms-` prefix, so its guidance now says `$oms-write` rather than `$write`, which would fail on a real install. A reference to `core/agents/retriever.md` was also removed: that path never shipped in the npm artifact, so it was broken for every installed user while resolving fine in the repository.

### Added

- `assets/skills/` is the single authored source for all six skills — `write`, `search`, `link`, `distill`, `status`, `doctor` — replacing four drifted copies. Frontmatter is restricted to `name`, `description`, `aliases`, `mcp_tool` and `mcp_args`; the five skills that declare a tool are validated against that tool's advertised schema, so a skill cannot ship arguments its tool would reject.

### Removed

- `skills-manifest.yaml`. It declared itself generated while no generator existed, had no consumer anywhere in the source, scripts or CI, and never shipped in the package.
